        <p class="description" id="week1">You should add personal summary or objective for entry-level roles in your cv. I thought it was waste of space, but it adds personality to a piece of paper

        <p class="description" id="week3">Hardware lab – I have never done it before. I enjoyed every second of this lab as I was learning something new and I was working with my classmates. Can I build my computer? NO! However, I can definitely show it off.

          <p class="description" id="week6">Networking – one word that scared me for a couple years due to the complexity of the topic. However, learning about IP and subnet mask made me realize that it is doable. This particular topic has more words and less numbers, which is not my favorite. Nonetheless, I am surrounded by networking so learning new topics was as easy as having a sweet treat after a big meal.

          <p class="description" id="week9">LinkedIn – don’t be shy to post about non related jobs, just be professional. No matter what you have done, you can make candy out of it. For example, I am a Software Developer, I am volunteering as an immigration assistant for Russian/Ukrainian communities in Western Mass. Does it relate to my career? No. Do I truly enjoy it? Every time.

          <p class="description" id="week10">Take responsibility for your actions. It is so easy to blame the job market, companies' layoffs and just bad weather for your missed opportunities/time. However, you must adapt and stay positive to get the job, because you never know. Also, Server Lab was crazy.
